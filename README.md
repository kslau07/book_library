# Project: Library (The Odin Project)

[Link to this project's specs](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-library)

Description: In this project we will make a simple webpage that can keep track
of books which we have to manually add. It will be good practice for learning JavaScript
constructors, prototypes, and HTML forms.

Update: After going through the Odin lesson on JavaScript classes, we will now
convert our JavaScript code to build objects using classes instead of plain constructor functions.

Tech used: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
